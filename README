My config files and whatnot for KeySnail, an Emacs/Vim-friendly keyboard control plugin for Firefox.

A long time Vimperator, I recently switched to KeySnail for the following reasons:

Speed: Using the built-in 'awesomebar' KeySnail is much faster when it comes to bookmark/history autocompletions. Also the hit-a-hint plugin responds much quicker (and in my opinion is more efficient) than the vimperator hinting system.  I found that while using vimperator on my netbook I always had to wait for autocompletions to 'catch up' with me--entering keywords too quickly would result in Google searches instead of the bookmarks themselves.

Simplicity: KeySnail doesn't completely overhaul the Firefox UI...toolbars are untouched by default, built-in shortcuts work unless you choose to overridden them, etc.

Flexibility: KeySnail is actually catered to Emacs users (ala key sequences), but is equally suited to modal Vim-like control. Custom functions are easily bound to keystrokes, event hooks, etc.
